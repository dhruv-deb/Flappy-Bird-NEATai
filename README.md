# Flappy-Bird-NEATai

An AI-powered version of Flappy Bird that learns to play through neuroevolution using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The AI learns to navigate the bird through pipes by evolving neural networks over multiple generations.

# NEAT Algorithm

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks. It basically takes inspiration from the evolution of life and survival of the fittest.
